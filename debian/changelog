fwupd-signed (1.0) cosmic; urgency=medium

  * Initial release.
    - This is a package to support the signing of the EFI bianry now contained
      directly in the fwupd package.
    - The binary does not need to be installed to the EFI system partition at
      package installation like fwupdate, but will instead be directly copied
      at runtime only when needed.
